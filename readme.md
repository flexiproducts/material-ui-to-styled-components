-> find useStyles usage -> remember the name, e.g. `const classes = 
-> find parent Function
-> find return of that function


## for this project
-> asssume name if useStyles will be `classes`

-> find classes variable
-> find attributes (should be `classnName`)
-> find component
    -> component name needs to be used for `styled-components`
    -> replace <span open={true} className={classes.backdrop}> with <Backdrop open={true}>


## Assumptions
- Styles will be declared with `const useStyles = `
- Classes will be used in functional components and always be called `classes`
